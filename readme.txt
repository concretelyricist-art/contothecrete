This is an instruction text about ho to make changes to this site. 

The majority of things to change if you want to modify anything will be in the folder labeled "src".

In that folder is two folders one called lib and one called routes.

Your main interest is the routes folder. inside is a group of more folders.

These folders have matching names to the different pages on your site. The about folder is your about page, the shop page is where your merch is and so on.

whether in the routes folder itself or inside any of the folders in it is a +page.svelte file. That is the context of that page. 

So the routes +page.svelte is your main homepage, the about folder has a +page.svelte file and that's the context of your about page.

If you want to modify a page there is a pen icon in the top right of the context box for a specific page. 

you will look for two types of signifiers, h tags which will look like <h1> or <h2> And the end of it like a period would be </h1> or </h2>.

those are heading tags, they would be words that separate sections and are bigger than general text.

General text like a paragraph will be in a <p> tag and and like </p>. So you would change the content inside the <p> tag</p>

Images can be found in the lib folder that is in the src folder. It is labeled Images. 

Inside that folder is a gallery folder. That is the group of images that show up in your gallery. 

Your best bet to view all the images together would be to probably download the whole project folder. 

You can do that from the base page of the project on Github: there should be a green button labeled 'code'.
In that dropdown is a 'download zip' option. That will download the whole project folder. you can take the images folder out of that.
